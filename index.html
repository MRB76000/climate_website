    <h1>How are planes bad for our planet?</h1>
<p>Earth has been home to many types of life for millions of years, from humans to dogs to fish to the trees in your backyard, our planet has helped us all live by giving us all places to call home.
    From warm beaches to cool swamps, from dry deserts to massive rainforests, every part of life is flourishing from what our planet has provided. But in the past few hundred years, our planet has been changing. 
Alot of what we do everyday creates harmful gasses called carbon emissions, which over time make our planet hotter and change the habitats of all humans, plants and animals, making it harder for them to live. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Planes account for 2.5% of global carbon emissions</li>
        <li>Planes have contributed of around 4% of our planets entire global warming</li>
        <li>Our atmosphere is increasing at around 0.11&deg;F per year</li>
