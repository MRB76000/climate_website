                <p id="map">Earth has been home to many types of life for millions of years, from humans to dogs to fish to the trees in your backyard, our planet has helped us all live by giving us all places to call home.
                    From warm beaches to cool swamps, from dry deserts to massive rainforests, every part of life is flourishing from what our planet has provided. But in the past few hundred years, our planet has been changing. 
                Alot of what we do everyday creates harmful gasses called carbon emissions, which over time makes our planet hotter and changes the habitats of all humans, plants and animals, making it harder for them to live. </p>

        <h2>What do Planes do?</h2>
        <h3>While planes are really good at getting people from one place to another, they produce the largest amount of pollution per trip and are one of the biggest contributors to climate change.
            Planes have produced 4% of all carbon emissions around the world and have only been around for about 100 years. If we keep flying planes as often and as reckless as we do, our planet will continue to heat up at an unstable rate, ruining the habitat of countless plants and animals...

    <h3>While it is clear that planes are a big problem for our enviornment, we can't just get rid of them as people rely on them for things like going to work or to see family. But we can take actions to slow down the amount of emittions produced by planes per year and help save our planet. Here are some options that I think are the best:</h3>
