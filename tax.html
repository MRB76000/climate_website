    <p class="sans">A so-called "frequent flyer tax" is an idea that has been gaining traction as of late, particularly in the U.K. that says that people who fly often or make long distance flights more then the average person should have to pay a fee everytime they do so. This idea is a good starting point for this airplane crisis as it would be really easy to start as soon as possible, but it also isnt enough to make a considerable impact in global warming as people who make those long, frequent flights, usually have extra money to spend. </p>
